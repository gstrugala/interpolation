# Fortran interpolationâ€”backup repository

[`permap.py`](./permap.py) : python code to create a dummy performance map
filled with random values, called `permap.txt`.

[`interpolation.py`](./interpolation.py) : python implementation of the
algorithm interpolating data from the performance map. The code is written in
such a way that it is easily translatable in Fortran.
